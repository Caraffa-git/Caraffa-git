Hi, my name is Caraffa and I am an electronics enthusiast (currently studying in Warsaw) and ~~unfortunately~~ a self-taught programmer. At the moment I'm mainly interested in the high-voltage part of electronics, but in the near future I'll focus on low-voltage projects. You can write to me on discord at any time.
